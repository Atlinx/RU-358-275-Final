In an expedition to South America, he encountered the Quarequa, a indigenous tribe located in now modern day Panama. According to colonial accounts in \"De Orbo Novo\" (Decades of the New World),

\"Vasco discovered that the village of Quarequa was stained by the foulest vice. The king’s brother and a number of other courtiers were dressed as women, and according to the accounts of the neighbours shared the same passion. Vasco ordered forty of them to be torn to pieces by dogs. The Spaniards commonly used their dogs in fghting against these naked people, and the dogs threw themselves upon them as though they were wild boars or timid deer. .  When the natives learned how severely Vasco had treated those shameless men, they pressed about him as though he were Hercules, and spitting upon those whom they suspected to be guilty of this vice, they begged him to exterminate them, for the contagion was confned to the courtiers and had not yet spread to the people. Raising their eyes and their hands to heaven, they gave it to be understood that God held this sin in horror, punishing it by sending lightning and thunder, and frequent inundations which destroyed the crops. It was like wise the cause of famine and sickness” (qtd. in Driskill 53-54).

Deborah A. Miranda, a modern day indigenous poet, would label this form of violence as [b]\"gendercide\"[/b], because \"this is not homophobia... What the local Indigenous people had been taught was ... the killing of a particular people because of their gender” (qtd. in Driskill 54).

In interpreting this account, it's evident that colonialist placed themselves on a pedestal to justify this \"gendercide.\" For example, they relied on dubious claims of deviance being the cause of \"lightning and thunder,\" \"frequent inundations\",  and \"famine and sickness.\" And the account of the indigenous people's response is questionable -- Were they truly \"[pressing] about [Vasco] as though he were Hercules,\" or were they merely appeasing the conquistadors amidst the fear of being murdered?"
